Multi-class weather dataset(MWD) for image classification is a valuable dataset used in the research paper entitled “Multi-class weather recognition from still image using heterogeneous ensemble method”. The dataset provides a platform for outdoor weather analysis by extracting various features for recognizing different weather conditions.

Images:1100+

Categories:
0:Cloudy
1:Rain
2:Shine
3:Sunrise

## Project Details
I have used Open Cv for reading and reshaping images and then they are processed further using Numpy
I have created a Convolution neural network which can take image as an input and ouput the class which the image belongs.
Image is reshaped to 240 cross 180 so that we can fit in the memory.
